# Shift-Tracker

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, and run the development server:

```bash
npm ci
# process.env works without dotenv package & without NEXT_ prefix (in server side code)
# !!IMP : check .env.example on instructions about which variables
# you need to setup and naming convention
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Pre-requisite knowledge

Bare minimum technology you need to familiar with:

- React.js (how the rendering cycle works)
- Async nature of javascript
- Optional Asset: if you're familar with Typescript & weird nature of Javascript
- Next.js : You need to be familiar with page/layout/default.tsx ..etc naming conventions of Nextjs.
- Git, somewhat basic knowledge of the workflow even if you're not familiar with Git-CLI
- Optional Tiny Asset: if you know the difference and relation between Git & Github.

### Recommended learning material

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

#### Git, and everything else

This paragraph is optional reading, if you want free good learning resources as a student.

For this, you'll need to connet your Github Account with your University provided email.
Also, if you're using an account made using University Email, make sure to add a secondary email (which can be your gmail/[proton-mail](https://proton.me/mail) account).
Basically have two email on your Github Accont (personal and university provided).

If you're a student, sigin to your Github Education Pack account, [signup if you don't have one](https://education.github.com/pack/join).
You'll need some form of validating your status as a student (more details on Github Website).
